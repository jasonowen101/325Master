Create a book sorting tool in Java. The tool will allow users to sort a list of books by category, author, title, length, and popularity. The end product should display the sorted books in the terminal.

Subtask 1: Create Book Class
- Task: Define a Book class with attributes for category, author, title, length (in pages), and popularity (rating).
- Requirements: Include appropriate constructors, getters, and setters.

Subtask 2: Implement Sorting Interface
- Task: Create a sorting interface called `Sortable` with methods for sorting by category, author, title, length, and popularity.
- Requirements: Define method signatures for each sorting method.

Subtask 3: Implement Concrete Sorting Class
- Task: Create a concrete class that implements the `Sortable` interface.
- Requirements: Implement sorting methods for each category, using appropriate algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort).

Subtask 4: Create Book Database
- Task: Create a class to manage a database of books.
- Requirements: Include methods for adding, removing, and retrieving books.

Subtask 5: User Input
- Task: Develop a class for user input and interaction.
- Requirements: Allow users to input books and choose sorting options.

Subtask 6: Sorting Algorithm Integration
- Task: Integrate the sorting algorithms from the concrete sorting class into the book database class.
- Requirements: Ensure sorting methods work correctly with the book database.

Subtask 7: Sorting Logic
- Task: Implement the logic for sorting books based on user input.
- Requirements: Use the sorting methods from the concrete sorting class to sort books as per user's choice.

Subtask 8: Display Sorted Books
- Task: Create a class for displaying sorted books in the terminal.
- Requirements: Implement methods to print books neatly in the terminal after sorting.

The goal of this assignment is to allows you all to work on individual subtasks independently, focusing on specific aspects of a larger team project. It covers various OOP concepts, including abstract and concrete classes, interfaces, and class hierarchy. Once all subtasks are complete, the entire class will have a functional book sorting tool.
